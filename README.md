# simulation-of-ants 

Use [Finite-state machine][] to simulate behaviors of ants.

Initially, ants will move randomly in an attempt to search for food. Once an ant finds a piece of food, it will return to its home. When it arrives home, it will roam randomly in search of water. Once an ant finds water, it will resume its search for more food. Returning food to the home will produce a new ant from the home. There are also randomly placed poisons and they have a fatal effect on ants.
